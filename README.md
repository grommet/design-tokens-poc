# hpe-design-tokens

Design tokens for the [HPE Design System](https://design-system.hpe.design/). This project is still in a draft state and evolving as we receive early feedback from stakeholders.

A design token is a design decision. These design elements are used repeatedly across products, and therefore need to be packaged in a format that's deployable across technologies and platforms.

## Current state

Currently, there are tokens for global concepts like spacing, rounding, border sizing, and content widths as well as tokens for fundamental components like anchor, button, headings, text, and data tables (among others). 

## Installation

```
yarn add hpe-design-tokens
```
OR
```
npm install hpe-design-tokens
```
